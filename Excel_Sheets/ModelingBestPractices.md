#  Step 1 :Modeling Best Practices

2 Crucial Easy Rules:

1. Almost evry projection is simply a % of revenue
2. Look for patterns in the data



25 Modeling & Valuation Best Practices:

1: Modeling is easier than you think and a lot of fun, if you remember 2 key items: 

​	1:  Most items you model are simply a % of revenue!

​    2: The second key item to remember is that  modeling is all about looking for patterns and then projecting those patterns into the future. 

3: Publicly traded companies are often quite large and, as a result, although growth is positive, growth is usually decelerating. 

4: If growth is not decelerating for a large publicly traded company, then it might be because they made a sizeable acquisition.

5: When a big company sees a significant decrease in the rate of change of revenue growth, they usually focus on increasing margins.

6: Use your own common sense and build the model yourself before speaking with the company about your estimates (they can sell!). 

7: If a company has a lot of cash, they either make acquisitions or they buy back shares. Look for patterns in the share count.

8: Forecasting taxes is tough. Find out from the 10-k or 10q what the N.O.L.s are and after you exhaust them, ask IR for guidance. 

9: Items that you hard code (meaning anything that is in your model that is not a calculation) should be in a blue font. 

10: Cells that contain data from other tabs in your spreadsheet  should be in a green font.

11: Always use at least 3 valuation methodologies to come up with your target price. Then take an average of all 3.

12: Create a sensitivity analysis to see how your target price changes with different growth and discount rate amounts. 

13: Create bearish, neutral ("just right") and bullish scenarios too if you are highly unsure what the economic environment will be like. 

14: If you work in teams (as you do often on the sell side or in investment banking), then please add many comments (with your  initials).

15: If you feel overwhelmed with the complexity of a model, build it slowly and "group" items. 

16: Modeling can often be as much of a science as an art. Accept the fact that your estimates will never be 100% correct.

17: Listen to earnings calls, read ER press releases and all 10-q, 10\-k, 8\-k and S1 filings and reflect those calls/documents in your model.

18: Creating a model takes time. When I think I am done with my model, I sleep on it and do 1 final review the next morning. 

19: Understand who your customer is. If it's a hedge fund, then they likely don't like DCF. If it's a value investor at a mutual fund, they do, etc.

20: Know what the size the Total Addressable Market (T.A.M.) is and use it as a sanity check to see if your estimates seem realistic.

21: Add all supplemental data provided by IR in your models (at the bottom of the model if you don't know where to put it). 

22: Percent items should be italicized...in fact spend a lot of time "prettying up" your model. It makes sure your attention to detail is high. 

23: Name your rows and columns so you can use natural language math like: "net income / revenue" instead of cell x3 / t8 (forexample):

24:  Feel comfortable with $A$1 to lock in cell references, $A1 row only references and A$1 column only references (huge timesaver).   

25: You have the same access to information for your models that the pros have! Have fun building it!!!!! : )
